An essential WeakSet poorlyfill legacy browsers that don't have even a WeakMap but need just a [WeakSet](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakSet).

  * CDN via https://unpkg.com/@ungap/essential-weakset
  * ESM via `import WeakSet from '@ungap/essential-weakset'`
  * CJS via `const WeakSet = require('@ungap/essential-weakset')`

Compatible down to IE9, works well with ES5 shim upfront in IE8 (and maybe lower too).
